Arg-ument-

CnAr. r. Cicero sets forth to his friend Atticus his :notive in composing the work. —
2. Scipio and Laelius ask of Cato his experience' of old age. — 3. Cato recounts the charges
commonly made against old age, and qualifies them. — 4, ς. He speaks of the old age of Fa·
bius Maximus, employed in politia and war, and of other examples, both Greek and Roman,
philosophers and poets. There are four complaints against old age: exclusion from active
lise, the enfeebling of the bodily powers, deprivation of sensual pleasure, and the near
approach of death. -6. Does old age unfit for active life? Age has its own activities:
Claudius, Cato, etc. -— 7, 8. The alleged defect of memory: examples of aged poete, philoso—
pher& orators, etc.. and of others, who continue to learn in advanced life. —9, ιο. Lack
of bodily vigor: only the athletes mourn this, and even this is not universal among the old.
Exercise and temporanee resist old age: examples of Nestor and Cato himself. Cyrus and
Masinissa.- n. Nor is strength needed, and if many old rnen are inferior, so are many
Α young men, We must withstand old age, both bodily and mentally, as did Appius Clau·
dius ς for only a sels-respecting independent old age is honored. - ιι. Age, it is true, iz
inoepable of bodily pleasure: but in this it has the advantage over youthful passion. -
¹3· The false teaching of the Epicuream respecting pleasure.— ¹⁴» Old age has still the
true joys of companionship, scie-nee, and authorship. — ¹5· So also the occupatione and
delights of husbandry: testimony of Hesiod and Homer. — 16. Curius and Cincinnatus:
agriculture is peculiarly fit for the old. -- ¹7· Xenophon, Cyrus, Valerius, and others. —
18, But only a well-spent youth mn prepare for an honorable age: the unhappiness οἱ
age is the fault of temper in the old. —19. The approach of death: comparison of exposure
to death in age and youth. -2o. Death is no evil; but either a cessatiou of being, or a
blessed change.—2t. The good man hopes for immortality. -ει The dying Cyrus.-
²³· The hope which sustains honorable labors3 anticipation of a noble life.

ς 1. Tite. In addressing his friend Titus Pomponius Atticm,
Cicero elegantly applies some hexameters from Ennius’s Annales,
addressed to Titus Quinctius Flamininus the conqueror of Macedon
(3.0. 198). The incident here referred to was when, after being
for 40 days baffled in an attempt to cross the mountain passes of
Epir-m, he was at last approached by a faithful herdsman, who offered
to guide him across, The victory of Cynoscephalae which followed,
ΒΩ. 197, gave Flamininus unlimited control over Greece‚ which he
used with great moderation. At the Isthmian games near Corinth,
he formally restored their independence to the GreekS, after which
both Greece and Macedonia remained independent for about
fifty years, — adiuero, ς 30, 6, a. —curm anxz‘e’tffi an account otf
