youth was spent in “ thrift‚ hardship, and tillage,'’ varied, as
he came of age, by pleading in the local courts. He served
in South Italy against Hannibal under Fabius Maximus
(3.0. 212 and 209), again under Nero (3.0. 207) probably as
military tribune, ‘in Sicily and Africa as quaestor under
Scipio (3.0. 204), as consul in Spain (3.0. 195), and as
legatus at Thermopylae, where he contributed largely to the
victory over Antiochus· Though by birth a simple yeoman,

in forcing on the third and last war with Carthage. He died
the following year, at the age of eighty-five.

Cato is best known by the severity with which he exer-
cised the censorship. This gave him the name by which he
is best known, Censor-im, or the censor. This office was
then at the height of its efficiency‚ and was an engine of
almost despotic power. The men holding it had the un-
restricted right to make out the list of Senat01·S‚ that is, to
determine who should govern Rome for the next five years;
and, on the other hand, to punish, by expulsion from the
Senate, by a private stigma of infamy, or even by the entire
