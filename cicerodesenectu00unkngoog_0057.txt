stern conservatism so far as to make a study os Greek (see ὅ 3);
but at the time alluded to he was the last man in Rome to make
an ‘⁴ intimate ’' of a mere man of,letterS‚ of Greek birth too, like
EnniuS. Indeed, he reproached M. Fulvius Nobilior, the leader in
the Hellenizing movement of the day, for having taken Ennius with
him on his campaign in AEtolia. -- cunctando, hence the name

In spite os his ill repute as a demagogue, and his military ffilure, Flaminius was the
author of some very salutar-y measures. In his tribunae, ις. 232, he carried the law here
referred to, dividing the Gallie and Picene territory among poor citizens, -the policy after·-
