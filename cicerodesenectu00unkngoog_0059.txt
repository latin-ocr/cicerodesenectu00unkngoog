pal sumptuary laws of the RomanS, or laws designed to control
the private life and luxury of individuals.

“The Voconian law, passed during the later republic, 169 αα, impoeed a restriction on

the institution of women as heirs. It applied only to large estates. A person whom the
census placed in the first class, as having a rated property of at least one hundred thou-

sand asses (i. e. one thousand dollars, which in purchasing power was worth as much as ten
thousand now). such a person was forbidden to appoint a woman as heir . . . The alleged

design of the statute is said to have been to restrain the growing luxury and extravagance of
women, by withholding stom them the means oi being luxurious and extravagant on a large
scale. ltcan hardly be supposed. however, that this was the principal reason sor the meas-
ure. A stronger reason must have been the desire cf the wealthy class to keepffarge estates

ξ 16. Claudi: Appius ClaudiuS, known as Caecus (the blind)
or the Censor, one of the few men of real genius among the
statesmen of the old Republic. In his‘ censorship (B.C. 311) he
attempted some democratic innovations (which were set aside
by his successor, Q. Fabius MaximuS, ancestor of the Cunctator)
and built the first military road, the Appia Via,· he-also was the
first to bring a supply of fresh water into the city by the Aqua
Appia. The incident here related of him, that when blind and
old he had himself brought into the Senate in order to oppose
negotiations with Pyrrhus, and to insist that there should be no
negotiations with a foreign enemy on the soil of Italy, is the
most illustrious in his life. The speech in which he enforced this
policy was extant in the time of Cicero, and passed as the earliest
