5 43. Cinea: Cineas was a pupil of Demosthenes, whom Pyrrhus
sent as ambassador to Rome after his first victory, over Laevinus
(13.0. 280). Two years later was the Roman embassy of Fabricius
and others to Pyrrhus, to whom Cineas returned the hospitality
which he had experienced in Rome—quendam. i. e. EpicuruS,
whom Cicero never loses an opportunity to attack‚ and to whom the
Stoics were especially opposed (see “OrationS,'’ note to Sest.

lived with him, and so knew him better than to suppose him in-
fluenced by pleasure.—Deei0: P. Decius MuS, consul for the
fourth time, Re. 295. In his consulship was fought, at Sentinum,
the decisive battle against the great coalition of Italian nations,
headed by the Samnites (third Samnite War). When Decius saw
that the battle was going hard with his men, he devoted himself to
the gods by a solemn act of consecration (see Livy, viii. 9), rushed
into the thickest of the enemy, and perished. His death was
followed by a complete victory, which broke up the alliance,
although the war dragged on five years longer. The story went that
the father of Decius had devoted himself in like manner in the Latin
War, forty-two years before, B.C. 337. - Curius, the oldest of the
three statesmen here mentioned (cos, B.C. 290), had had personal in-
tercourse (vixerat) with Decius ; while Fabricius and Coruncanius
were only acquaintances (noral).—-pr0feoto, without question.—

test, see ξ 64. 1, b.-Duellium‚ cos, B.c. 260, in which year he
gained a naval victory over the CarthaginianS. Knowing the
: superiority of the enemy in naval tactiCS, he undertook to balance
this by a kind of boarding·bridge, which grappled the enemies' ships

and held them fast, after which the battle became essentially a land -

fight, decided by the prowess of the soldiers rather than by naval
manoeuvreS. This victory over the enemy on their own ground, in
a branch of warfare in which the Romans were wholly inex-
perienced‚ naturally was of incalculable value in raising their spirits
and confidence, and gained great reputation for their commander.

A column, adorned with the beaks of ships, was erected on the >

Forum in his honor, of which fragments are still extant. —- sump-
serat: this honor appears to have been granted by authority, not
assumed by himself, as the text would imply.
