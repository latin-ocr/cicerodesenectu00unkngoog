viii Introduction..

horridiora verbm* But though the discourse is put in
Cato’s mouth, it is Cicero that speaks, Not merely is there
the ripe Latin of the last century of the Republic, and the
perfection of style of the greatest of Roman authors, but
the thoughts 3ηά sentiments, even, are not such as belong
to the toughand hard-headed Cato, whom Cicero employs
as a lay-figure, to be dressed in the mental costume of his

own da .

practical sagacity, commanding the unshaken regard of the

character, by way of explaining the allusions in the body
of the work.
