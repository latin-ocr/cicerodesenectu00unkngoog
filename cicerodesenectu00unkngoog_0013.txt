Gmmx philosophy, at its beginning, six centuries before
our era, had consisted in fanciful speculations upon the
source and origin of the universe3 but before Cicero's time
it had come to embrace all human knowledge, and to be
the substance os all liberal education. It consisted of three
divisionS, —Natural Philosophy, Ethies, and Dialectics (in-
cluding Logic and Rhetoric), of which the second was
regarded as the most important. This learning was un-
known to the Romans until 155· B.c., when Carneades the
Academician, Critolaus the Peripatetic, and Diogenes the
Stoic‚ the most famous philosophers of their time, came on
an embassy from Athens to Rome, and discoursed upon their
respective doctrineS. Their learning and eloquence capti·
vated the young nobles, especially Scipio and Laelius, who
are introduced in the following treatise. From that time on,
all young Romans of distinction were instructed in the new
education. Α

Cicero, born fifty years later, was carefully educated in
these liberal artS, and always retained an interest in them,
of which his orations contain many indicationS. He early
formed the design of setting forth in Latin the whole body
of philosophy, a design which he may be said to have in the
main accomplished.

The first division, Natural Philosophy, is covered, though
not very fully, by De Natura Deorum, TimaeuS, and Phae-
nomena, and discussions of natural questions are interspersed
in the ethical works. To DialecticS, the second branch,
belong the first nine works in the list,* including CanoniC,
or the science of the test of truth. The remainder of the list,
except the Letters, belong to Ethies. “
