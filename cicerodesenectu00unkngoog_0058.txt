seems harsh. —fllfl consularis: this son, who had the same name
as his father, was consul B.c. 213. It is of him that the story is
told, strongly characteristic of Roman customS, that his father, being
sent as legatus to his camp, and meeting him as he proceeded with
his train of lictors, neglected to alight from his horse, as respect sor
the consul required. Upon this a lictor, at the son’s order, com-
manded him to dismount; when he sprang at once to his feet, with
the words, “I wished to see my son, how well you knew that you
were consul ’² (Liv. xxiv. 44). -est . . . laudatio, his eulogy

It was characteristic os both Greeks and Romans, and one of the chief sources of their
enduring sreedom, that they had no priestly class. but that the religion os the State and the
politioel administrationi of the State were in the same hands. A few priestly offioes os low
grade were held as professions by men os low rank: a few priesthoods os great dignity but “
of no political influence‚ such as that of rex sacreficulus, flamen, the Salii, etc., were held
for life by men of rank, selected solely for their patriciani birthz but the great conegoe ospon-
tt'fices, augure, etc„ which had control of the religious institutionis in their relation to the
government, were invariably made up of leading statesmen. For example, Cicero was
augur, Caesar was pontifex. From thie it resulted that the interests of a priesthood were
never, as in Egypt and other eastern countries, suffered to intersere with the interests of the
State. The jus augurium was the code of mles by which the college οἱ augurs interpreted
