§5 34-42·] De Senectute. ’ 47

of about the middle of the fourth century 13.c. (Plato died in 348).—

voluptatem, 5 6⁷, 1, b, R. —avidae, i. e. in their eagerness sor. — “

temere, heedlessly,· ecfrenate, nncurbed. — incitarentur, are im-
pelled (for the tense, see 5 ⁵8, 10, d).

5 40. hino == a eorporis voluptate. — proditiones, acts qs
treas-on (a common Latin use of the plural) ; eversiones, over·
throws. —nasoss spring. — denique, in a word. -ecelue‚ a more
abstract term than facinus. In Cicero's time, facinus appears to
have been mostly used in a bad sense; but not originally, aud
hence it is here qualified with malum. -stupra vero, and as to de-
bauclterics, etc. — excitari. stirred up. — muneri, sanction (if
given by nature) ; dono, gzfl (if bestowed by divine power).

5 41. neo enim. etc., for (of course) there is no room fhr sels-
control when lust is tyrant. —- fingere animo, ima 'ne. ——jubebaig
censebat: observe the partial retu‘rn td the dsfffil'gnlarrative—-per-
oipi (Qdk expmkngga'. —nihil agitare, pursne no subject. -“-
nihil . . . consequi. establis-h nothing by argument or reflection. —-
quocirca resumes as a conclusion the first statement, nullam eaeo,
etc„ in the indirect form, whence the subjunctives esset, entin-
gueret. -haeo, etc.‚ thus my host Nearchus used to say (that) lte
had heard that Archytas discoursed with Pontius. Pontius was the
noble Samnite who gave the wise advice, that unless the Roman
army at the Caudine F orks should be massacred to a man, it should
be released without dishonorable conditionS. The neglect of this
counsel‚ with the infamous duplicity of the RomanS, eost the life of

that gallant state. —oum quidem. at tlte ve time when (inter-
fuisset is the subj. of indir. disc„ not on account οἳ oum). .

16, 1. Camillo. etc.: this was 13.c. 349, the year before Plato’s

death. Plato’s latest authentic visit to Sicily (his third) was 361 ς
it is ,probable therefore that Cicero was wrong here.

5 42. quorsum haeo, what kas this been driving at? (5 49,
2, c). —intellegeretim etc„ imperf. as following the implied past
tense—invitus feci ut eicerem (5 ⁷0, 4, e) = I reluctantly ex-

, pelled.—'.l.'. flammini. see 5 1 ; his brother Lucius was consul

B.c. ¹92· During his consulship he carried on war successfully in
Cisalpine Gaul, at which time occurred the incident here related. - ς
fuisset, subj. as following eicerem. —septem annin this was the
fun number of years intervening between the consulship of L. Flamin-

inus (B.c. ¹92) and the consulship of Cato and L. Flaccus (184); the ’

censorship of T. Flamininus ,and M. Marcellus was nc. 189. (The
story is an illustration of the preceding sentence, but the old man's
loquacity destroys the logical connection). -notandam3 the tech-
nical word for the formal mark of disapprobation nota censoria, offi-
cially passed upon a man by the censors.--exoratus eet. was pre·
vailed on, compare Liv. xxxix, 433 Plutarch Flamin. 18.
