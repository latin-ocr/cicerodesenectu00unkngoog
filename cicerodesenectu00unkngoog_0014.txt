vi Introduction.

The circumstances which led Cicero to devote himself
more especially in his later years to philosophy have been
briefly touched on in the sketch of his life prefixed to the
orations· During the first year of Caesar's supremacy
(B.C. 46), we are told that he gathered a sort of school about
him in his retreat at Tusculum, where ‘⁶ he trained Pansa,
Hirtius, and Dolabella like a preceptor,’' seeking distrac-

tion from the defeats and calamities of his public life.* The ι

death of his daughter Tullia, early in the following year,
with other and more ignoble domestic sorrOWS, confirmed
his disposition to solitude, and his desire to find comfort in
“the calm and still air of delightful studieS.’' † The memory
of his griess he sought to banish by spending whole days in
composition. To this year belong, among other philosophi·
cal writingS, the Academia, the De Finibus, and the T us-
culan ,Ques-lions. The death of Caesar, with the new polit-
ical hopes it brought, broke off these labors for a while;
but before the final struggle with Antony began was another
short interval of literary activity‚ in which were composed

the treatises De Natura Deorum, De Divinatione, De.

Fato, De Gloria, and De Officiis, as well as the two
brief Dialogues De Senectute (Cato Major), and De
Amicitia (Laelius).

Probably no one of his shorter writings is better known or.
more generally admired than the dialogue ‚on Old Age. It

'⁸' “While Ι languished in idleness, and the condition of the State
was such that it must needs be ruled by one man’s counsel and care,
1 thought, first, that philosophy should be unfolded to our people
for the sake of the State itself, holding it to be of great consequence
to the honor and glory of the body politic (ct'vitas), that things so
noble and weighty should be had in Latin writings. 1 was urged
to this, besides, by that sorrow of beart, caused by the great and
heavy blows of fortune; for which if 1 could have found any greater
comfort, 1 should not have taken refuge primarily in this3 but in no
way can 1 better share that comfort, than by giving myself not only
to the reading of books, but to the handling of philosophy at large.”
N. D. i. 14. Δ
